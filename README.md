The main cause of financial loss is giving loans to "risky" candidates.
(called credit loss). When a borrower defaults on a loan or flees with the money due, the lender suffers a financial loss known as a credit loss.  

The primary goal is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants so that the amount of credit loss can be reduced by reducing such loans. 
The objective of this case study is to identify such candidates using EDA.   

Analyze the variables that are reliable indicators of failure in order to comprehend the driving forces (or driver variables) behind loan default.  
This information can be used by the business in inventory management and risk analysis.
